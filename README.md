## Philosophy

### **About Me**

When I'm not coding, I'm stargazing. Space and astrology fuel my creativity, bringing that sense of wonder into every project. This cosmic perspective shapes how I approach problems - with curiosity, precision, and an eye for the bigger picture.

### **My Approach**

```text
Build → Test → Learn → Iterate → Ship
```

### **Core Values**

- **Innovation over convention**
- **Collaboration over competition**
- **Impact over ego**
- **Continuous learning over comfort zones**
