# Building the Future with Code, One Line at a Time

Hey there! I’m Jay Patel, a software developer who’s all about blending technology and design to create solutions that matter. My work dives into the wild world of Web3, the smarts of AI, the flow of mobile apps, and the strength of cloud infrastructure. I’m here to craft experiences through code that actually mean something—and I’d love for you to join me on this ride. Let’s shape a future worth building.

## About Me: Where Code Meets Creativity

I spend my days shaping mobile apps with Flutter and Dart, making them smooth and easy to use. On the web side, I build sharp, solid applications with React and Tailwind CSS. Outside the screen, I’m fascinated by space and astrology—it’s where I get a lot of my creative spark. That mix of logic and wonder is what drives me and defines my studio, AnnnDromeda.
